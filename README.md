# Get Auth0 Access Token
A script I created in AWS Lambda to make a post call to a private url for retrieving an Auth0 access token anytime a user logged in so their profile data could be retrieved. A similar script was also used when updating user parameters and as part of a webhook for automated newsletters.

This utilized an understanding of Javascript, REST APIs, third party APIs, AWS Lambda generation and utilization, NodeJS, and JSON parsing.
